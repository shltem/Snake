<h1>Snake Game</h1>
<p>This is a console-based implementation of the classic Snake game. The player controls a snake that moves around the board eating food pellets, growing longer with each pellet it eats. The game is over when the snake crashes into a wall or its own body.</p>
<p>To control the movement of the snake, use the arrow keys on your keyboard.Be careful not to run into the walls or the snake's own body, or the game will be over!</p>
<p>
<p>
There may be issues with the game's display on certain operating systems or console environments due to differences in terminal or command prompt capabilities. </p>
<p>Future development plans for this Snake game project include adding features such as colored graphics, sound effects, and a score display to enhance the gaming experience. Additionally, I want to work towards a more advanced display of the game</p>
<h2>Compiling and Running the Snake Game</h2>
<p>To compile and run this project, please follow these steps:

<p>1. Click on the green "Code" button on this page and select "Download ZIP" to download the project to your computer.</p>
<p>2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location on your computer.</p>
<p>3. Navigate to the 'Snake-master/src/main/java' directory in the extracted files.</p>
<p>4. Open a terminal or command prompt in that directory and run the command 'javac *.java' to compile all the Java files in that directory.</p>
<p>5. Once the compilation is complete, run the game by running the command 'java Main' in the same directory.</p>
<p>This should start the game and allow you to play it. If there are any issues with compiling or running the game, make sure that you have Java installed on your computer.</p>
